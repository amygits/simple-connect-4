# Simple Connect 4 (W/ tests)

The (Java) code should launch a Connect 4 GUI that allows a user to engage in a game with a computer player over a server.  Computer player will make random movements with no intention of beating the player.  Test classes are included.

This was made as part of an assignment for a class I took in Spring 2020.
